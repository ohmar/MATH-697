# MATH 697 - Matrix Multiplication

This repository contains code used in my MATH 697 class. This code was used to analyze algorithms for matrix multiplication.

## Background

Originally implemented the naive algorithm for matrix multiplication using 2d arrys but this was highly inefficient. Optimized naive to a suitable speed. Implemented Strassen's algorithm using 2d arrays but that was S L O W. Reimplemented it using linked-lists and got something usable. Still need to expand some more here on how it was done. See paper for more information!

## Efficiency

No caching is used with the Strassen implementation as a linked list. It would definitely benefit with some.
